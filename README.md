# Vityarthi-CSE-Project
This project offers a Python-based Modular Expense Analyser System that can track spending trends, classify transactions, record expenses, and conduct statistical analysis.

Overview of the Project
The Modular Expense Analyzer System is a financial tracking tool that manages user financial data (expenses and income) in a CSV file. It provides a simple, menu-driven command-line interface for data entry and offers powerful analytical capabilities using Pandas and NumPy for calculations and Matplotlib for generating visualizations (charts). A key feature is its ability to handle data in Rupees (Rs) and separate expenses (negative amounts) from income (positive amounts) for accurate trend analysis.



Features

The system offers the following core functionalities:
Data Persistence: Stores all financial records in a secure, structured CSV file (data/expenses.csv) ensuring data is saved between sessions (Reliability NFR).
Expense/Income Recording: Allows users to easily record new transactions, prompting for date, category, and amount, with built-in input validation for amounts and category choice.
